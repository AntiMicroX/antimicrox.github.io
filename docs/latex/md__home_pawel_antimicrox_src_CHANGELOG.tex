Version 2.\+21


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed unplug routine slightly. The old behavior was slightly wrong anyway but the old behavior did not work with S\+DL 2.\+0.\+4.

2015-\/09-\/29 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+19.\+3


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Fixed overly active timer used to reset acceleration distances when no events are returned from S\+DL in a given gamepad poll.
\item Sebian translation updated by Jay Alexander Fleming.
\item Changed behavior of 4 Way Cardinal mode for D\+Pads. Diagonals are no longer counted as a dead zone. This change is more likely temporary. Up+\+Right -\/ Up, Down+\+Right -\/ Right, Down+\+Left -\/ Down, Up+\+Left -\/ Left

\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/08-\/15 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+18


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Perform event simulation in its own thread. Timer used for mouse speed calculations has improved as a result.
\item Slow down Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve slightly. Changes were mainly due to overall mouse emulation being tweaked.
\item Distributing 64 bit builds for Windows again.
\item Using a simulated event to click the minimize button in title bar now works on Windows. The move to using a dedicated thread for event simulation allows that to work now.
\item Simplified Chinese translation added thanks to zzpxyx.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/08-\/02 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+17


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed Enhanced Precision acceleration curve. The curve has been slowed down slightly.
\item Changed how initial mouse movement is performed when the gamepad poll rate and the mouse refresh rate differ.
\item Flash interface buttons after restoring the main window from the tray icon.
\item Tweaked mouse movement remainder routine. Remainders now only apply when the direction along an axis is the same.
\item Raised maximum cycle reset time to 60 seconds.
\item Fixed improper cycle reset interval.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/07-\/22 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+16


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Loosen initial mouse movement experienced after going outside the dead zone.
\item Added option in the mouse settings section that would allow antimicroX to reset the acceleration values being used for the uinput virtual mouse pointer. This is useful after playing older Linux games that change the acceleration settings for all mouse pointers after a game exits. Postal 2 and Doom 3 are two examples of games in my game library that exhibit this behavior.
\item Queue all events before performing any actions. The priority of various events has been changed as well.
\item Added option to change the gamepad poll rate used by the application. By default, the old 10 ms poll rate will be used.
\item Bundle a few backup icon files. Mainly useful on Steam\+OS since the themes used don\textquotesingle{}t bundle a couple of essential icons that are expected to be present.
\item Compiled vmulti support into Windows build. The driver is not currently provided. The program needs to be started with the arguments --eventgen vmulti.
\item Temporarily stop packaging a 64 bit version of the program for Windows. Unfortunately, the version of Qt being used has a problem regarding timer accuracy that is not experienced with the 32 bit version of Qt being used. At this time, working around the problem is not feasible so there will be no 64 bit release. Please use the 32 bit version.
\item Change shortcuts used for the .msi package.
\item Bundle Qt translation files for Windows version.

Version 2.\+15


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed routine for extra acceleration for mouse movement. The new version is a bit faster and more responsive than the previous version.
\item Added release circle setting for spring mouse mode. This can be used to have the mouse return to a region around a character based on the last detected direction of an analog stick.
\item Added a sub-\/menu to the virtual keyboard. Some multimedia and browser keys can now be selected.
\item Added Execute slot type. A program can be set to launch when a slot is activated.
\item Added Text Entry slot type. You can now have a string of text typed when a slot is activated. This can be useful for inputting common commands in games.
\item Added proper interpolation to determine the start of diagonal regions of analog sticks. This is used for mouse movement in order to determine the proper starting dead zone point.
\item Changed Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve. The new changes in the curve should be much looser than before.
\item Fixed --unload command line option. Enforce reloading of config file when finished.
\item Fixed issue with spring mouse mode where the mouse would temporarily return to center when switching stick directions quickly.
\item Fixed some bindings in the virtual keyboard when using Send\+Input for the event generator.
\item Fixed issue with widgets used to update stick and dpad delay. The spinbox can now be used to edit the delay.
\item Reduced multiple instances of some objects. Reduces memory usage slightly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/05-\/01 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+14


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Refactored extra axis acceleration. This revision uses individual gamepad polls again. Other changes in the code have made switching back feasible. With minor adjustments, the mouse will be looser but very controllable.
\item Added longer duration for extra axis acceleration. This allows extra acceleration to be performed over a period of time as opposed to just one gamepad poll.
\item Changed key repeat routine when using Send\+Input on Windows. Key releases restart the last active key repeat delay.
\item Now using Qt64-\/\+NG for the 64 bit Windows builds.
\item Initial experiments with vmulti support in the Windows version. Using that driver would allow antimicroX to use a virtual keyboard and mouse rather than using Send\+Input. That would allow antimicroX to work around U\+AC problems and anti-\/cheat programs. Support is not currently compiled into the Windows builds due to not being able to properly distribute the vmulti driver.
\item Do not write empty names tag in profiles if no custom button names have been specified.
\item Allow mouse history buffer size to go up to 100.
\item Allow diagonal range to go up to 90 degrees.
\item Remove old mouse speeds from mouse history buffer if stick has been returned to the dead zone. History buffer will be filled with zeroes.
\item Omit hotplugging dependent code when compiling against S\+DL 1.\+2.
\item Fixed dpad pointer bug when certain Queued\+Connection slots are executed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/03-\/31 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+13


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated extra axis acceleration routine. Now, extra acceleration is calculated after an axis has stopped moving past the assigned threshold in one gamepad poll.
\item Stick presets now change the diagonal range of a stick. This is mainly beneficial for mouse control changes so that 65 degrees is used by default.
\item Added a screen selector for Spring mouse mode in settings menu.
\item Added a small language selection portion to the settings menu.
\item Added a small logger. Please run antimicroX with \char`\"{}-\/-\/log-\/level debug\char`\"{} in order to get output about button presses.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/03-\/22 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+12.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Implemented a small wizard that will be run when antimicroX is launched for the first time. It currently only has a page for editing some of the mouse settings and a page for associating antimicroX with .amgp files on Windows.
\item Show slots that are active for a stick modifier button on the main interface. The text for the main stick direction buttons will be prefixed with the currently active slots of the stick modifier button.
\item Corrected issue with stick and dpad events not getting activated on a set change. Events were being queued but not executed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/03-\/15 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+12


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added option for extra mouse acceleration. Enabling that option will increase the speed of the mouse based on the amount an axis has travelled in one gamepad poll and the set multiplier. This will greatly affect how the mouse behaves and it will make mouse movement looser. Using this feature can be problematic if the analog stick on your controller is worn out and loose.
\item Corrected issue with extra mouse sync events occurring when not needed (0,0 events). This change seems to have smoothed out mouse movement on the low end of an axis a bit.
\item Tweaked controller unplug workaround to still invoke release events for axes and buttons. For triggers, the release value is modified from what is provided by S\+DL so an unplug event will cause a release event to occur for the triggers.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/02-\/25 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+11.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added workaround to allow gamepad unplugging on Windows to not activate bindings for the triggers. This was caused by the way controller unplugging is handled by S\+DL (primarily with the Windows version). S\+DL sends a release value for all elements of an unplugged joystick a brief period before sending the expected S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+J\+O\+Y\+D\+E\+V\+I\+C\+E\+R\+E\+M\+O\+V\+ED event. The problem is that the released value used for triggers assumes that the dead zone is half the trigger\textquotesingle{}s full range. This would cause bindings for triggers to usually activate for a brief period before S\+DL would send the final S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+J\+O\+Y\+D\+E\+V\+I\+C\+E\+R\+E\+M\+O\+V\+ED event which would then deactivate those bindings.
\item Changes for the portable Windows version. Allow relative profile paths for use in the portable package on Windows. Associate profiles registry change prompt skipped.
\item Queue stick and dpad events. Allows for better control of 8-\/way sticks and dpads.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2015-\/02-\/07 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+11


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adjusted the Enhanced Precision, Easing Quadratic, and Easing Cubic mouse acceleration curves. The low end of each curve has been loosened a bit and the rest of the curves have been adjusted accordingly. Comparing the two versions, the resulting mouse speed for a given axis point is slightly lower in the new versions for most of the curve. The extreme low end and the extreme high end of the curves will be slightly faster.
\item Updated Qt to version 5.\+4.\+0 for the Windows builds.
\item Compiled a 64 bit version for Windows thanks to the Qt-\/x64 project.
\item Added a set changing slot.
\item Added App\+Data for use when packaging on Linux thanks to Jeff Backus.
\item Fixed bug with mouse wheel event methods for axes which resulted in negative values being passed to the event timer.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/12-\/29 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+10.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed event handler fallback method under Linux.
\item Changed interface of Assignments page in Advanced Button Dialog.
\item Reset set number upon changing profiles.
\item Added \char`\"{}\+About Development\char`\"{} tab to About Dialog.
\item Fixed dynamic text resizing in Button Edit Dialog under Linux.
\item Fixed launching a second instance in order to load a profile in the first instance.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/12-\/10 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+10


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed allowed values for easing duration. The minimum value has been lowered to 0.\+0 and the maximum value has been increased to 5.\+0.
\item Added a stick modifier button. This button is primarily meant to be used to assign walk/run functionality to an analog stick. Instead of having to create distance zones and assign keyboard modifier keys to each stick button, you can now make the assignment on the stick modifier button and it will apply to the stick as a whole. It makes assigning walk/run functionality to an analog stick much less cumbersome. The Dread\+Out demo has already shown a use case where only the stick modifier button was needed due to the demo not handling running when using the left stick on an Xbox 360 controller.
\item Increased idle mouse timer interval to 100 ms.
\item Added a load profile slot. You can now tell the program to load a different profile upon pressing a button.
\item Added gradient functionality for the high end of the Easing Quadratic and Easing Cubic mouse acceleration curves.
\item Raise process priority on Windows. Now, the antimicroX process will run with High priority. This allows internal timers to work better and be less susceptible to the activity of other running programs. On Linux, the priority of the main thread has been increased.
\item Take multiple direction buttons into account when assigning set switching to stick buttons.
\item If uinput is enabled but not usable at runtime then X\+Test will be used as a fallback option for the Linux version.
\item Tweaked Gradient and Pulse turbo modes to make them a bit tighter. A lower delay will be needed in profiles to achieve a similar control from previous versions. On the plus side, this has been tested to work with Flat\+Out 2 fairly well. It is good enough to use and actually win some races against AI opponents.
\item Added analog control for mouse wheel buttons that are mapped to an axis button.
\item Tweaked mouse movement code to improve mouse accuracy. This is mainly due to discovering the Q\+Elapsed\+Timer class that is included in Qt.
\item Fixed middle mouse button binding when using the uinput event handler on Linux.
\item Fixed memory leaks that were discovered by Valgrind.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/11-\/19 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+9


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added mouse refresh rate as an option. Please be mindful of how your system behaves if you set the refresh rate to a low value like 1 ms. In the worst case scenario, you could end up dedicating one C\+PU core on just the antimicroX process. Also, on Windows, you will want to make sure to disable the \char`\"{}\+Enhance Pointer Precision\char`\"{} option if you use a low value otherwise Windows will severely slow down the mouse pointer.
\item Added an application level mouse smoothing option. The older button level smoothing option has been removed. The old option didn\textquotesingle{}t do much since it only dealt with the partial distance remainder.
\item Button responsiveness has been improved. The old mouse movement code was creating a bottleneck for button processing which would result in a slight delay.
\item Changed mouse movement code. The overall mouse movement should be smoother now.
\item Allow the Windows setting \char`\"{}\+Enhance Pointer Precision\char`\"{} to be disabled while antimicroX is running. This will make sure Windows does not directly manipulate the mouse events sent to the system. This will allow mouse control on an analog stick to be more accurate on Windows.
\item Changes to Auto Profile to allow more variables for matching. Multiple window properties can be specified which will cause antimicroX to count an entry as a match only if all specified properties match.
\item Changed how windows are grabbed in X on Linux.
\item Minor fix for Gradient and Pulse turbo modes. There were times when the timer interval controlling those modes could be negative and cause problems.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/11-\/05 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+8.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed some buttons in virtual keyboard when program is using uinput support.
\item Fixed Update Joysticks option for S\+DL 1.\+2 users.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/10-\/28 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+8


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added delay settings for analog sticks and dpads. This is meant to keep some games from overreacting when switching directions quickly. A delay is especially useful for games that utilize a dash on a key double tap. This will also be very useful while playing rougelike games. The new delay setting allows for more responsive controls than the old alternative of using hold zones on individual direction buttons.
\item Added two new mouse acceleration curves\+: Easing Quadratic and Easing Cubic. These new mouse acceleration curves are meant to mimic the camera control that is used for gamepad support in some recent first person shooters such as Borderlands 2. Once a stick direction has reached a threshold (80\%) then the mouse speed will gradually accelerate over a period of time before the mouse speed reaches its peak. The duration of the easing method is set at 0.\+50 seconds by default but the setting is configurable per button.
\item Major refactor to mouse event generation. The new routine requires fewer system resources and it is more accurate.
\item Made uinput support a runtime option for Linux users. The program can now be compiled with both X\+Test and uinput support and the event generator can be specified using the --eventgen flag. It defaults to X\+Test if available. The option is only available when the program is compiled with both X\+Test and uinput support.
\item Added right click context menus for buttons in main interface.
\item Fixed issue with Game Controller Mapping dialog. Controller D\+Pads that are exposed as 4 buttons can now be bound to the D\+Pad of an S\+DL Game Controller.
\item Fixed an issue with incorrect profile names being displayed in the profile combobox.
\item Fixed issue introduced in version 2.\+7 regarding mouse movement calculations for the left direction of analog sticks. A major portion of the safe zone for that direction was being skipped.
\item Changed button groups in the main interface to update immediately when a stick or dpad mode has been changed.
\item Initial removal of old joystick abstraction support in interface when using S\+DL 2.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/10-\/14 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+7


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a U\+AC workaround for use in Windows. antimicroX can be restarted as Administrator in case a game is running with elevated permissions and the events generated by antimicroX are not detected by a game.
\item Added more key aliases for uinput support.
\item Force higher dead zones for axes in Game Controller Mapping window.
\item Fixed virtual keyboard in Button Edit Dialog window for Linux users utilizing X\+Test support.
\item Display some minor mouse stats in Mouse Settings dialog.
\item Alter Analog Stick dialog window to show some new stats. Also, show square stick coordinates as well as adjusted circle stick coordinates.
\item Added square stick to circle stick conversion.
\item Fixed issue with V\+K\+\_\+\+L\+S\+H\+I\+FT and V\+K\+\_\+\+R\+S\+H\+I\+FT aliases not being saved properly on Windows.
\item xinput is used for the uinput virtual pointer in order to disable mouse acceleration for the pointer. This allows spring mode to work as intended.
\item Added some code to guess which axes of a gamepad should be considered triggers by default while in old \mbox{\hyperlink{classJoystick}{Joystick}} mode. The initial values of axes are taken from S\+DL and those are used as the point of the axes while centered. If the initial value of an axis is below -\/30,000 then an axis is considered to be a trigger.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/09-\/16 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+6


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added two new Turbo modes. Gradient mode is used to change the key press time depending on the position of an axis (useful for racing games). Pulse mode is used to change how many times a key press is invoked depending on the position of an axis (scrolling in a web browser using arrow keys).
\item Fixed profile resetting in a couple of places.
\item A Russian translation has been provided by Dima Koshel.
\item Added option to invoke Game Controller mapping window from command line. The final mapping string will be printed to stdout. This is useful for saving a S\+D\+L\+\_\+\+G\+A\+M\+E\+C\+O\+N\+T\+R\+O\+L\+L\+E\+R\+C\+O\+N\+F\+IG for your controller that can be used system wide. Any S\+DL 2 game can then be set up to use that mapping and it can be changed if needed.
\item Profiles now use a unique .amgp file extension. Older xml profiles will continue to be supported.
\item Fixed spring mouse mode so that it uses proper axis distance values.
\item Set changing has been fixed for analog sticks and virtual dpads.
\item E\+X\+P\+E\+R\+I\+M\+E\+N\+T\+AL. uinput support has been added to the source code. Binary Linux packages will continue to utilize X\+Test for event generation for the time being. If you would like to test uinput integration then you will have to compile the program using -\/D\+W\+I\+T\+H\+\_\+\+U\+I\+N\+P\+UT=ON and -\/D\+W\+I\+T\+H\+\_\+\+X\+T\+E\+ST=O\+FF when running cmake. Playing Warsow 1.\+51 in Linux using antimicroX requires using uinput integration. Also, keys can now be pressed in a tty.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/08-\/01 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+5


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed packaging the Windows version so the program will work on Windows XP again.
\item Delay rendering of flashing buttons. This helps improve controller responsiveness when the main window is not hidden.
\item Reduced the size of written profiles. Only changed values are now stored in profiles.
\item Updated German translation provided by phob and Leonard Koenig.
\item Allow a profile to be listed as the final argument on the command line. Ex\+: antimicroX $\sim$/antimicro\+X-\/profiles/profile.xml.
\item Added diagonal distance support for distance slots for Standard mode on Sticks and D\+Pads. This was necessary for some modifier assignments to work properly. The best example is for assigning walking in Half-\/\+Life 1.
\item Allow generated events to be sent to a different X display than the application is running on. This change was mainly done to better work with Steam\+OS. antimicroX can be run via ssh with X tunneling in order to configure profiles on one system but the program will send events to the X display that is running Steam and games.
\item Auto Profile support has improved for Steam\+OS. Application grabbing can now be done while in the Steam\+OS B\+PM Session. Steam B\+PM can be grabbed as well.
\item Only show active or soon to be active slots for buttons in the main window. The text displayed on the buttons will update when a new zone has been reached due to using slots such as distance or hold.
\item Allow no profile to be assigned to an application for an Auto Profile entry. This means that the program will choose an empty profile when the application for that Auto Profile entry has focus. This will help with disabling antimicro for applications that already have controller support.
\item Controller Mapping dialog now stops processing events until all elements have been released on a controller.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/05-\/30 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+4


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Relative spring mode added.
\item Key repeating changes in Windows.
\item Updated Windows version to use Qt 5.\+3.\+0.
\item Set copying added.
\item Corrected application checks used for Auto Profile support in Windows.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/05-\/23 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+3.\+3


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tweaked Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve.
\item Tweaked \char`\"{}all\char`\"{} option in Auto Profile. No profile assigned to \char`\"{}all\char`\"{} now implies that a blank configuration should be loaded.
\item Manpage created by Jeff Backus.
\item Migrated to the C\+Make build system.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/05-\/15 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+3.\+2


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed problem with old profiles not being usable in the program.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/05-\/13 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+3.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new Enhanced Precision mouse curve. It is now the default mouse curve. The new mouse curve will make the cursor move slowly towards the low end of an axis and the cursor movement will be accelerated towards the high end of an axis.
\item Added unsaved profile dialogs.
\item Added key repeating behavior under Windows.
\item Increased maximum turbo interval.
\item Added more options to the Edit Settings dialog.
\item Added profile name display editing.
\item Fixed invalid pointer issue for Hold events.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/05-\/02 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+3


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a daemon mode.
\item Added joystick profile compatibility parser for game controllers. Old profiles are now usable when using S\+DL Game Controller support. Old profiles have to be mapped against the same controller that is connected.
\item Added cycle reset support. Sequences with cycles can now get returned to the first cycle zone in a sequence after a period of time.
\item Changed Auto Profile support to work properly in Steam\+OS while running the Steam\+OS Big Picture Mode session. On many tested games (Duke Nukem 3D, Super\+Tux, World of Goo), the game had to be run in windowed mode in order for Auto Profile support to be able to detect the application. It is recommended that you run games in windowed mode when using Auto Profile support in the Steam\+OS B\+PM session. This is not an issue when running the Steam desktop client in desktop mode.
\item Added a delay slot type. A delay slot can be used for key presses in a key combination. Unlike other macro slots, slots placed before a delay slot will remain active after the specified time has passed.
\item Added option to allow the program to start on Windows startup.
\item Changed dialogs for secondary set buttons to display the set that the button is currently in.
\item Changed turbo mode to give more control. Key presses are now given more time to be active. Key presses and releases now run for a duration of t/2 seconds.
\item Altered tray menu to display a single list when only one controller is connected. An option has been added to allow for a single list to also be used when multiple controllers are detected.
\item Fixed issue with Windows XP Auto Profile workaround. On the plus side, now the program is confirmed to work in Windows XP.
\item Fixed issues with Auto Profile support saving and precedence.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/04-\/19 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+2


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added example controller display to Game Controller Mapping dialog window.
\item Added Auto Profile support. Allows for profiles to be associated with specific applications.
\item Added button icons in Windows version.
\item Added a press time slot type. That slot type is used to have keys active for a specific period of time.
\item Allow Pause slots to have a 0 second interval. Allows for a forced key release.
\item Windows version is now built with S\+DL 2.\+0.\+3.
\item Fixed 8-\/Way D-\/\+Pad mode.
\item Fixed preset options in various dialogs to account for new aliases.
\item Fixed ampersand rendering in set buttons.
\item Fixed spring mouse mode dimension support.
\item Fixed spring mouse mode accuracy under Windows.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/02-\/28 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new stick and dpad modes.
\item Added set names.
\item Minor fixes for Windows.
\item Fixed Q\+Settings usage to reduce reads and write to config file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/02-\/10 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+0.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Active keyboard keys now use a reference count. This will be useful for keeping modifier keys held when moving a stick from a diagonal direction to a cardinal direction. This will allow a run to be maintained properly.
\item A release delay has been added to release slot events. This is needed for some games where a key press and release might happen too quickly for a game, such as The Elder Scrolls IV\+: Oblivion, to catch it.
\item Altered data sent to Send\+Input under Windows. The change should allow games that rely exclusively on scancode data to detect keyboard key presses now. Previously, keyboard emulation would not work while playing The Elder Scrolls IV\+: Oblivion on Windows.
\item Improved key associations under Windows. V\+K\+\_\+\+O\+E\+M\+\_\+$\ast$ keys associations are now generated at runtime which will allow associations to be more layout independent.
\item Changed some portions of the Windows version so that the Numpad Enter key can be emulated.
\item The recent profile list is now updated when a profile is added or removed from the list as opposed to when the program is closed. This allows the list to be in sync while utilizing hotplugging.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2014-\/01-\/04 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 2.\+0


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Migrated profiles to use Qt key values as opposed to using native key code values. Allows for better cross-\/platform compatibility. Current joystick profiles will be migrated when first loaded by the program.
\item Program can now be compiled against S\+DL 2.
\item The Game Controller A\+PI provided by S\+DL 2 has been integrated into the application. The A\+PI is used to abstract various gamepads to a unified standard. Profiles made against the Game Controller A\+PI can be used with any controller that is supported. Unsupported controllers will have to be mapped in the program.
\item A simple Game Controller mapping window has been made so people that are using an unsupported controller can map that controller so that it can be used with the Game Controller A\+PI. Any saved mapping string will be loaded into S\+DL when antimicro is first launched or when you select the \char`\"{}\+Update Joysticks\char`\"{} option in the main window.
\item Any new saved profile will include the device type that it is associated with in the filename. Joysticks and game controllers use slightly different file specifications.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{classJoystick}{Joystick}} hotplugging support has been added thanks to S\+DL 2.
\item On Windows, X\+Input support is now available. This allows the Xbox 360 controller guide button to be usable and both gamepad triggers can be used at the same time. Previously, only Direct\+Input was being used so both triggers were being mapped to one axis so they would negate each other if used at the same time. This problem would really affect people trying to play Call of Duty with a 360 controller when the \char`\"{}\+Hold Aim Down the Sight\char`\"{} option is enabled in the game.
\item The list of recent profiles is now tied to a joystick G\+U\+ID or joystick name if the G\+U\+ID is not available (compiled against S\+DL 1.\+2).
\item Program options window has been made. For right now, it is only being used to allow users to be able to disable Game Controller integration for specific controllers.
\item Mouse events are queued before a mouse event is sent to the system. This allows for smoother diagonal mouse movement. This really helped improve camera control for me in Warsow.
\item Key checker dialog has been made so you can check the alias values that are being used for keyboard keys. This is mainly for debugging purposes. If you find that a keyboard key that you use does not have a built-\/in alias, please let me know so an alias can be added. Although, the key can still be used in the program and saved to a profile. The major downside is that a profile that uses an unsupported key will not be cross-\/platform compatible.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2013-\/12-\/13 Travis Nickles \href{mailto:nickles.travis@gmail.com}{\texttt{ nickles.\+travis@gmail.\+com}}

Version 1.\+2


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved while held set changing so that the program should not get stuck on the wrong set. The changes made should behave roughly like the old while held workaround that used turbo.
\item Windows port of antimicro has been made.
\item Tweaked code used for button presses and releases in order to improve responsiveness.
\item Allow time-\/dependent action slots to have an interval as low as 0.\+01 seconds.
\item Tweaked Release action slot. Release slots can now be placed at the beginning of the assigned slots. This can be useful for Tap and Hold slot configurations.
\item Pause slots can now be used with Release slots.
\item Profiles can be removed from the recent configs list.
\item Spring mouse mode preview has now been enabled.
\item Mouse speed modifier action slot has been added. This can be used to modify the mouse speed settings used with any controller element while the slot is active. The setting will modify the mouse speed by the percentage that is specified. The mouse speed modifier can be used to allow for the mouse speed to be slowed down while sniping.
\item Button and action names have been added. Names can be used to describe the action that a slot sequence performs in the game.
\item Mouse wheel buttons are now used as a form of mouse movement. Mouse wheel scrolling is now possible without using turbo. The speed that the wheel is rotated can be specified in the mouse settings dialog window.
\item Added support for two extra mouse buttons.
\item A new controller properties window has been made. This window shows various bits of information provided by S\+DL about a controller as well as the current values of all the controller elements.
\item Added quick assign functionality for sticks and virtual dpads.
\item Windows version of the program now uses Local\+App\+Data variable to know where to place the program\textquotesingle{}s settings file.
\item New translations provided by the translation team.

Version 1.\+1


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added spring mouse mode. This mode is used to move the mouse cursor from the center of the screen based on how much an axis has been moved from the dead zone. The mouse cursor will be returned to the center of the screen when the axis is released.
\item Added mouse curve options from Q\+Joy\+Pad.
\item Tweaked mouse movement in cursor mode to improve axis responsiveness and to allow mouse movement to be less jittery.
\item Added optional mouse smoothing for a further reduction in jitter in exchange for slightly delayed responsiveness.
\item Moved various mouse settings into a new dialog window. Several other dialog windows have been changed to point to the new dialog window to allow for mouse setting adjustments.
\item Added an option to start the program hidden.
\item Tray menu has been tweaked to allow configuration profiles to be disabled. A blank new profile will be enabled in the program for a controller. This is equivalent to selecting $<$\+New$>$ in the main window combobox.
\item Serbian translation provided by Jay Alexander Fleming.
\item Brazilian Portuguese translation provided by Va\+G\+NaroK.

Version 1.\+0


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 8-\/way controls have been implemented. This allows keys to be mapped to the diagonal directions of controller sticks and dpads. 8-\/way controls allow rougelike games to be playable.
\item Virtual Dpad support has been added. Axes and buttons can be mapped to a virtual dpad. This is useful for mapping dpads that are detected as a pair of axes in S\+DL.
\item A Quick Set option has been added. Using the Quick Set option, you can press a button on the controller and the program will bring up the edit window for that specific button. The button can then be mapped to an assignment from the edit window. The Quick Set option also works for axes, controller sticks, and dpads. This is more of a convenience function than anything but I have found it really useful since implementing it.
\item Main interface button text is now updated whenever the assigned slots are changed. This allows the buttons\textquotesingle{} text to be in sync in many situations that was not possible before.
\item Toggle and Turbo can be used together to create automated key macros for use in M\+M\+O\+R\+P\+Gs.
